- 👋 Hi, I’m @0xSardius
- 👀 I’m interested in using web3 technology to disrupt industries overly reliant on brand-based trust models.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning hybrid smart contract development with Chainlink, and Moralis to build dApps fast cross-chain.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building cross-chain web3 projects that securely integrate on and off-chain data.
