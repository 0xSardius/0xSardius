## About Me
I build AI-powered applications with onchain functionality, specializing in rapid prototyping and shipping products on Base.

With over a decade in crypto, from running mining operations (BTC, LTC, ETH) in 2017-2018, to a web3 consulting business (2022-2024), I've developed a practitioner's understanding of what works onchain. As a v0 Ambassador, I demonstrate how to move quickly from idea to deployed product using modern AI tooling.

My background in Lean Six Sigma and program management lends me a focus on continuous improvement to ensure quality evolves with user needs over time.
